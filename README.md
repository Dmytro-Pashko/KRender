## Overview
KRender SDK is a cross-platform mobile SDK that provides the possibility to render 3D scenes using Kotlin. SDK based on the popular LibGdx library and provides a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use solution for rendering 3D graphics on mobile devices.

KRender SDK provides a scalable and maintainable architecture for mobile app development, based on the best practices of the industry. With great multithreading capabilities using Kotlin Coroutines, KRender SDK makes it easy to create complex 3D graphics applications that perform well on a variety of devices.

In addition to its powerful rendering capabilities, SDK provides a range of basic shader and app functionality, including a logger, file provider, asset manager, asset loader, networking, and serialization/deserialization, making it easy to configure and customize your app as needed.

Whether you're building a 3D game, a virtual reality app, or a 3D modeling tool, KRender SDK provides everything you need to create high-quality, performant, and visually stunning 3D graphics applications for mobile devices.

### Key features:

* **Fully Kotlin Oriented**: SDK is written entirely in Kotlin.

* **Build system**: The build system of SDK has been implemented using Kotlin DSL scripts, providing a more convenient and flexible way to configure modules and customize builds. SDK inculdes predefined tasks to assemble executable builds (APK, JAR, Ipa).
